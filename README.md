## Introduction

First quarter of 2022 has ended, Maven Telecom company requires a full analysis into the working of the business to understand how the business has performed so far and where improvement is needed. Using Excel and Power BI i was able to; 
* improve retention by identifying high-value customers and; 
* churn risks 

## Questions

what this project will be addressing

1. Identification of high value customers;

To identify high value customers, we will use attribute from the record such as 

      a. Using the records attribute (columns)to determine high value customers e.g., Monthly charge, 
          Total charges, extra data charges premium Tech Support etc.
      
      b. Identifying cities with more customers and going further to see cities with these high value customers.
      
      c. Using our services and product to identify high value customers e.g., internet type, offer, contract etc.
      
2. Churn ricks;

       We can see from the record that we have customers who churned; we will conduct a deep dive to determine 
       the reason for churn and whether our services influenced this.

## End Results
Recommendation from analysis
*	Having customers who left due to higher prices and extra data charges, while competitors are providing better and lower prices based on the reasons given why customers churned, it is recommended to increase data offer and match prices while also improving internet speed.
*	Staff must be trained in customer service because, according to the analysis, customers have left due to poor treatment from staff.
*	With the goal of improving services and products, offer E promotion should be replicated because it has proven to be a successful venture in the past.
*	Improvements are required in areas such as website self-service, network reliability, and the various services provided to customers.
